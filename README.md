## Hi, I'm Miles

I'm a 17-year-old student at Lincoln High School and North Seattle College, aspiring to work in interdisciplinary data science.

I'm very passionate about programming, having started self-teaching when I was just five; you can often find me working on projects in my free time. I'm proficient (and entirely self-taught) in Python, C++, Java, Rust, MATLAB, R, and others. I have also worked to teach many others how to code and demonstrate its wide variety of applications.
I'm open to currently open to work; see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-caprio-4622a326a/), [Resume](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjPTAjzvct4lk7lTTEjYV6wFyB9fdA?e=ZqALzM), and [Detailed Programming Experience Summary](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjPTAjzvct4lk7lU3paPb4h3UQG2rQ?e=iNCRY0)
